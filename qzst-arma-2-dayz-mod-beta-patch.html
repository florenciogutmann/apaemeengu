                            <p>Been a long time lurker here since 2014, and have always been up to date with DayZ's development. Patch after patch grinding day and night and enjoying every second of it. I haven't played since June since I got my fair share of .62 and recently I tried Exile mod on Arma 3. After installing tons of mods and playing for a bit, I didn't have the same fun I remembered having with DayZ. Now I'm craving beta and hope to god I can get that same adrenaline rush that only DayZ can provide. #The last answer was posted at 22:20:07 (UTC Standard) ( October 19. Consider the QampA complete. ampnbsp; --- #TL;DR Cherno high rises aren't being removed. An enormous amount of player actions are being re-written in EnScript, which is 300% faster than the current language - SQF. Hicks is still undecided whether or not players should be able to disable post-processing completely - as critical character information is displayed Hey guys, i have had some courses and good reads about game development in university. I am no game but a software developer, but i am familiar with the theoretical steps of developing a game. In this thread i will try to give an overview what alpha, beta and release means (because i often see people having a completely wrong view of what a game in alpha really is about). I will also try to explain what the devs are doing wrong and where they are on point with their work, as well as judge. 
This is one of the few nostalgia servers and its really looking for players. Currently a decent 5 players at a time maybe 7 at Peak times. This is something everyone wants and loves. Share it with friends family and youtubers. I will be uploading a video w/ footage and installation guide soon so stick around. If you want to play now feel free to use This Link ( Video Of Installation (https://www.youtube.co. UPDATE: Seems that at some point today or yesterday DZC updated and added 1.8.2. I'm not sure how well it is working because I haven't used it to install/update in a long time, but hopefully population on official mod will pick back up now that people can get on the right version. ------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- UPDATE 2: dotjosh has contacted me and stated that there was an issue with a feature I was thinking about writing an article for r/dayz for few months now. There is a lot of misunderstandings which I will try to clear up to my best ability. Many of the redditors of this sub have voiced their oppinions on the subject of dayz development yet most of the arguments they use are far from objective and based on oppinions. I decided to write this in a form of QA and hoping to give better arguments to both sides of the discussion. Before this starts I would like to ask everyone 
After answering a few questions about installing Lingor Island for DayZ in another thread, I thought I'd make a step-by-step tutorial. NOTE This tutorial is made for DayZ_Lingor v031. The mod has since updated to Dayz_Lingor v032. It should still work as long as you use the mod download from the official site (www.dayzlingor.tk), but I cannot assist with the new version if there are errors. NOTE 2 - THIS TUTORIAL HAS LONG-SINCE BEEN OUT OF DATE. IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH IT, IT'S PROBABLY. Incoming wall of text!! TL,DR below A lot of SA players these days have been showing interest in trying out the mod, and I assume a lot of people will be jumping on the Steam Summer Sale Arma 2 offer for . The thing is, though, DayZ mod has become very confusing because of a plethora of different server types and various mods of DayZ mod. Because of this, people often join a variant of DayZ that is completely different from what they thought the game would be, and immediately become. I love this game. I absolutely love it. To me it embodies qualities that make it the ultimate multiplayer survival game. The recent 1.8.1 patch made it even better. No other game has given me the thrill, entertainment, adrenaline rush, laughter, and memorable moments that this game has. Sadly, right when the game had made a huge leap forward in development, it seems to have all but died off. I'm really bummed out about it. I know a lot of people really love playing Epoch/Overwatch/Overp. 
EDIT!!! I am working on an way better method than this. Stay updated! ; Ever since Lingor Island came out I have wanted to play it. All the other tutorials I have followed have not been very in depth, or have worked. So, I decided to make my own. This is for the Steam versions of ARMAII:OA, if you have the retail version I believe it will be a very similar installation. Step 1 : Download Lingor Island itself, here ( While. Hello all, just wanted to let you know (as ive seen a few people talking about frame issues on here lately) that the newest beta patch on commander (105785) causes huge frames drops and lag. I generally run DayZ at 30fps but this patch was reducing me to 10. As far as im aware it only really affects low end machines such as mine, and only really hits other mods such as origins, breaking point and what not, but i still think this is kind of a big problem. Quoting Razor49 EDIT: DAYZ44 IS NOW ON COMMANDER. ENJOY Since this is not on commander yet and I know a lot of people are looking forward to playing this, I decided to show you how to manually install the mod. I will be showing you how to play with the Steam version of Arma2/Arma2OA but it should work the same for retail copies. This will not effect your normal set up in any way, in fact you can play it through commander as long as you add the correct launch parameters. Ok, enough talk here's what you need:. I've been lurking this subreddit for quite some time now, played the DayZ mod when there were roughly 10-20,000 people playing it, when it was in its infancy. To Rocket: Forget what the people in these communities say, the alpha footage looks fantastic. What people fail to realize is that you have spent this amount of time rebuilding the architecture and the engine from the ground up so it can accommodate what you have wanted it to do. You have changed the base line of the engine to handle thing. Hi there people. Never posted on reddit before. here goes! I will unload my makarov and check it's empty before I proceed. and the hatchet is in my alice pack, ok? beans? WHAT THE F@#$IS GOING ON? Dayz Commander is screwed. Bohemia says the new Beta patches are only available on steam. ( I don't use steam!) I bought the ARMA II OA box, I don't use steam. I made a steam account, I don't use steam. I downloaded a SIX gig something from steam, which i don't use. I follow the really. Hi guys I'm a bit confused about the installation of DayZ. I've installed ArmA 2 CO and DayZ through Steam, and it seems to be working fine, says version 1.6.2 or something along those lines. What is ArmA 2 beta patch? Does Steam auto-update this? If not how do I find out when I do need to update it? Is DayZ epoch an addon for DayZ or an entirely new mod? Thanks in advance for your assistance. 
Hello, I'm having a lag issue where every 2-3 seconds of gameplay it will freeze/lag for 1 second, the same issue discussed in this thread ( however no solutions have been found yet. This problem happens continually on over 24 different servers that I tried. I've tried turning my graphics and resolution to the lowest settings possible, but that wasn't the issue (I can run normal ARMA2 on highest graphics/re. I bought the Dayz mod along with Arma I and II and some others on the Humble Bundle Weekly sale yesterday but I quickly realized that the patch that my game is set to (1.63) is not what the servers are running on. I have tried everything to get my patch tried everything to switch what I'm running on to the 1.62.103 but nothing seems to work. I do use steam and I do have the DayZ:OA Beta running but that won't work either. Fixed FPS Drop Fixed? Recieving DAta taking forever Fixed Tents not saving Fixed Invisible skins Fixed Some clothing breaking the sver (broken leg glitch) Fixed Revample loot a bit NEW The "EAster egg room" (Pixel) spawns new zombies and some medical loot, there are also 2 barrracks there Updated Arma2_OA_Server1.exe is now the latest arma 2 beta patch on commander (check github and replace) IMPORTANT SET SIGNATURE VERIFCATIONS TO 2 (SERVER OWNERS ONLY) located For those wondering if buying ARMA:II CO in order to play DayZ is worth it, I'll present a couple of arguments that might help your decision. DayZ is the latest craze and trend in gaming over the past few months, with over 800,00 unique players within 4 months. For the few that don't know, DayZ is a realistic, survival-themed game set in a post-zombie infested world built on the ARMA II engine. The mod is still in it's alpha phase, so bugs and glitches will happen. The map of DayZ is based. This is about Arma2 I bought Arma 2: Complete Collection on steam a while ago (mostly to play the DayZ mod) and recently decided to play an actual Arma sp mission ( this (https://forums.bistudio.com/topic/111737-team-shadow-sniper-campaign/) to be precise), but I'm having huge trouble actually getting the mods to work. I tried to downloadampinstall the following mods (as they were required by the mission) : -CBA_CO -ACE -ACEX -ACEX_RU -MAP_EU then I downloaded the latest Arma2 collection has 157 games search majameja2000 on steam to view account email: majameja2000@gmail.com Games: Counter-Strike Counter-Strike: Condition ZeroAppID: 80, Game Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted ScenesAppID: 100, Game Half-Life 2AppID: 220, Game Counter-Strike: SourceAppID: 240, Game Half-Life 2: Lost CoastAppID: 340, Game PortalAppID: 400, Game Team Fortress 2AppID: 440, Game Left 4 Dead 2AppID: 550, Game Dota 2AppID: 570, Game Portal 2AppID: 620, Game Alien SwarmAppID:. I purchased all content for Arma 2 and I downloaded the mod, I've installed battleye and what not, however, when I try joining a server while not in the beta patch it says I have a bad version and need to get 1.62.103718. It says I'm running 1.62. I opened it in the beta patch and it says version 1.62 is available to download at www.arma2.com, so I proceed there with high hopes. I download and install the patch, run in both the beta and non-beta, but still have the same problem. When I purchased. So I bought ARMA 2: OA back in 2012 off Amazon, and played the mod back then with no problems. I'm trying to check out the mod again (since frankly I've found SA to be super disappointing) and I just cannot, for the life of me, make it work. I've been installing ARMA2:OA and the beta patch, running them, and then running DayZ commander. Last night I was able to get it to recognize the existence of my ARMA2:OA directory but not to actually launch the mod - so I uninstalled everything
